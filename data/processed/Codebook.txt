ids - unique string for each datapoint
angle - single float for the angle it which the image is captured, 133 missign values
band_1, band_2 - two images 75x75 flattened
label - 1 for iceberg 753/1604, 0 for ship, only for Train set

From this the processed data is:

train:
a - angle as float, missing values where replaced with -1   (float)
X - concatenated band_1 and band_2 across 3rd axis	    (float)
y - correct label					    (int)
ids - id of each image for submission			    (str)	

test:
a - angle as float, missing values where replaced with -1   (float)
X - concatenated band_1 and band_2 across 3rd axis	    (float)
ids - id of each image for submission			    (str)
is_natural - if the image is natural or machine generated   (int)
